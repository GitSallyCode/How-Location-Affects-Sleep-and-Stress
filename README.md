# Workplace Dynamics:How Location Affects Sleep and Stress

## Objective
This project analyzes **the relationship between work location and sleep quality among employees**, focusing on whether those who work from home have **better sleep quality and lower stress levels** compared to office workers. The analysis is driven by the rise in remote work since the COVID-19 pandemic, aiming to understand its impact on employee well-being.

## Goals
- **Analyze the Impact of Work Location on Sleep Quality**: Determine how working from home versus in the office affects employees' sleep quality.
- **Explore the Link Between Sleep Quality and Stress Levels**: Assess the relationship between sleep quality and stress, examining if better sleep correlates with lower stress.
- **Identify Departments with High Stress Levels**: Investigate stress levels across different departments to pinpoint high-stress areas.
- **Determine Effective Strategies for Reducing Stress Levels**: Explore actionable measures that can be implemented to lower stress levels in various sectors.

## Dataset
- **Dataset**: `remote-work-and-mental-health`
- **Provider**: Kaggle.com
- **License**: Apache 2.0
- **Columns**: 20
- **Rows**: 5000
- **Format**: CSV

## Files
- `Sleep_Quality_Analysis.ipynb`: Python notebook containing the analysis code and visualizations.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Key Findings
- **No Significant Difference in Sleep Quality by Work Location**: The analysis revealed no statistically significant difference in sleep quality between remote and onsite employees (p-value: 0.964).
- **Strong Inverse Relationship Between Sleep Quality and Stress Levels**: A perfect negative correlation (-1) between sleep quality and stress levels indicates that better sleep quality is consistently associated with reduced stress.
  
## Conclusion
While we cannot assert that remote work directly leads to better sleep and lower stress, we can confidently conclude that enhancing sleep quality could be a crucial strategy for managing employee stress.
